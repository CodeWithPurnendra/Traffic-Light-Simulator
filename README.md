# 🚦 Traffic Light Simulator

A simple **Traffic Light Simulator** built using **beginner-friendly JavaScript**, focusing only on **variables** and **conditional statements** — no loops, no functions, and no advanced concepts!  
This project visually demonstrates how traffic lights change from **Red → Yellow → Green**, following real-world timing and logic.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Built entirely with **basic JavaScript concepts**  
- Uses only **variables** and **conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)**  
- Simulates real **traffic light behavior**  
- Clean and easy-to-understand code for **beginners**  
- No external libraries or frameworks — **pure HTML, CSS, and JS**

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to use **JavaScript variables** to store light states  
- How to control logic flow using **conditional statements**  
- How to interact with **HTML elements** using JavaScript  
- Basic **DOM manipulation**  
- Simple timing logic (if implemented manually)
